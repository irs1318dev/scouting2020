"""Downloads FRC event data from remote FIRST API server via HTTP.

All FRC event data is stored in a server managed by FIRST and is
available for download via hyptertext transfer protocol (HTTP). The
scouting system downloads match schedules from the FIRST API server
and enters them into the database.

FIRST API documentation, including the required headers, URL format,
and rules for authorization, are available at
http://docs.frcevents2.apiary.io/# .

Module Functions
----------------

`server.model.firstapi.schedule()`: Downloads match schedules.
`server.model.firstapi.match_results()`: Downloads data showing who
won match and high-level match scores.
`server.model.firstapi.match_scores()`: Downloads detailed match result
and scores, including autonomous points, teleop points, fouls, etc.

Authorization
-------------

A username and authorization key is required to use the FIRST API.
Follow the instructions at
https://usfirst.collab.net/sf/projects/first_community_developers/ to
otain a username and authorization key from FIRST. Each team or
individual must have their own authorization key -- no key or username
are provided with the scouting system.

This module assumes the username and authorization key are stored in
server.auth. *They must be stored as **bytes** objects, not as strings.*
This means you must prefix the key or username with a 'b' character.
Example contents of auth module:
```
key = b"authorization key"
usename = b"team_username"
```

**Keep your authorization key private.** Ensure the auth module is listed
in your .gitignore file so it does not inadvertently get posted to
Github. The line `**/auth.py` will cause git to ignore any file named
auth.py, regardless of where it is located.
